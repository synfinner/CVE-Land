# CVE-Land

I'm working on a side project. In my use case, I needed to have a sort of API interface with some vuln data without performing tons of queries on external third-party services. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me, as I'm planning on adding things and making improvements. 

The API now uses mongodb as I am making a mini production instance on my network for this project. If you don't want to use mongo and just want to keep it to static file use, simply don't stand up a mongodb server. The code will automatically check and see if it can connect. If not, it will fallback to apiv1. 

## Setup

**Setup instructions have moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/synfinner/CVE-Land/wiki/Backend-Setup)**

### Auth Tokens

I rewrote how CVE-Land handles token creation. On first run, the application will generate you a salt so you don't have to. Secondly, you can now see, delete, and add user keys all through a new web ui. 

Accessing the web ui is done via the `/admin` path. 

**Default Login:** `admin/secret`

**Admin Login:**

**Viewing Users:**

**Adding Users:**

## Sending a request: 

You will need to send an authoized request to the api. 

`curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/gsd-database/CVE-2023-1027 -H 'Authorization: Bearer synfinner c0178xxxxxxxx9959de26e15'`

### Endpoints (v2):

**Get all data:**

- `/v2/CVE-2023-1027`

**Get baseScore (NIST):**

- `/v2/CVE-2023-1027/base-score`

**Get ExploitabilityScore (NIST):**

- `/v2/CVE-2023-1027/exploitability-score`

### Endpoints (legacy)

As of now, the API returns all data or just the baseScore (I'll add more eventually). I'll likely change this over to a wiki entry later.

**Get all data:**

- http://127.0.0.1:5000/gsd-database/CVE-2023-1027

**Get baseScore:**

## Notes and considerations

Please note that this project--in its current form--is the result of not being able to sleep and needing to easily obtain data for my use case.
