# CVE-Land

I'm working on a side project. In my use case, I needed to have a sort of API interface with some vuln data without performing tons of queries on external third-party services. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me, as I'm planning on adding things and making improvements. 

## Setup

- Clone the gsd-database: 

`git clone https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database`

- Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/synfinner/CVE-Land`

- Setup env

`python3 -m venv env`
`source env/bin/activate`

- Install requirements

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Notes and considerations

Please note that this project--in its current form--is the result of not being able to sleep and needing to easily obtain data for my use case.
