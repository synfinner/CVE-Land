# CVE-Land

I'm working on a side project. In my use case, I needed to have a sort of API interface with some vuln data without performing tons of queries on external third-party services. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me, as I'm planning on adding things and making improvements. 

## Setup

- Clone the gsd-database: 

`git clone https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database`

- Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/synfinner/CVE-Land`

- Setup env

`python3 -m venv env`
`source env/bin/activate`

- Install requirements

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Auth Tokens

**CHANGE THE VALUE IN SALT.JSON TO SOMETHING UNIQUE!!**

I've added a SUPER basic authentication mechanism. **Please note that this is not secured for production use.**

- Generate a token with `generate_token.py`

`./generate_token.py`

You will need to enter a name for the new user:

```
Enter the username: synfinner
Token has been hashed and saved to tokens.json for user synfinner
The plain token is: c0178xxxxxxxde26e15
```

## Sending a request: 

You will need to send an authoized request to the api. 

`curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/gsd-database/CVE-2023-1027 -H 'Authorization: Bearer synfinner c0178xxxxxxxx9959de26e15'`

### Endpoints

As of now, the API returns all data or just the baseScore (I'll add more eventually). I'll likely change this over to a wiki entry later.

**Get all data:**
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/gsd-database/CVE-2023-1027

**Get baseScore:**
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/gsd-database/CVE-2023-1027/baseScore

## Notes and considerations

Please note that this project--in its current form--is the result of not being able to sleep and needing to easily obtain data for my use case.
